# Advent of Code 2021

If you are interested in looking at my solutions I _strongly_ suggest you avoid the earlier days as these are very sloppy.

Day 12 has been annotated with the intention of trying to explain the basics of Haskell within my solution

## Why Haskell?

why not.

## Your Haskell isn't very good.

Please genuinely tell me how I could improve. I don't know any haskell conventions I was just sort of having a go with it.

## I have no idea what is going on.

Feel free to message and I'll try my best to explain.
